```bash
npm install @refinedev/cli@latest
```

Install `@refinedev/devtools` with `@refinedev/cli`

> ðŸš¨ If you don't have `@refinedev/cli` installed already, you can follow the [installation guide](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/documentation/cli/#how-to-add-to-an-existing-project) to add it to your project.
