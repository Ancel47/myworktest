Looking for open source Reactjs admin framework? Then here is the collection of the best Open-source Reactjs admin framework of 2021. 

<!--truncate-->

If you are reading this, chances are you are a developer researching options for delivering an admin panel or another internal tool. Together with you, we will take a look at the best admin panel frameworks in response to this need.

Motivation is our most important resource when developing a project. If you lose your motivation as your project progresses, you will not be able to produce a successful product. The point where you will lose this feeling the most is the point where you cannot meet your Business needs. Different UI / UX solutions may be requested for many business models and it is very important that you can realize them regardless of the framework you use. 

When you decide to use these types of frameworks, we need to know to what extent and how they solve your work. If we do not know what these frameworks do and how customizable they are, the problems we may encounter can reduce our motivation.

We will examine how the frameworks we will talk about solve our work and how customizable they are under the title of `Customization`.

## React-Admin

React-Admin is an  B2B application framework based on Material Design, using Material UI. It provides ready-to-fetch-data components, so you just compose them together to create an application.

It can fetch data from any API connected to the data source, like REST, GraphQL, RPC. Itâ€™s powered by React, React Router, Redux, and Redux Saga, while Material UI is responsible for the visual.

React-admin uses Redux and redux-saga for state management. React-Admin creates actions and reducers automatically. Developer should only create data provider, which is used for running requests to the server side and parse server responses. But in some cases it is necessary to run non-typical request to the server side, or to change custom Store parameters. In this case React-Admin gives possibility to create custom actions, reducers and sagas.

React-admin is a framework that has been developed for a long time and has a wider community. Besides being stable, it works with old technologies.

### Installation
* Can be included in another React app 
* Installation is very simple

```bash
npm install react-admin
#or
yarn add react-admin
```

### Features
* It can be used with any backend(Rest, GraphQL, SOAP)
* API-based. The UI fetches the data from an API connected to the data source.
* Powered by Material UI, Redux, Redux Saga, React-router.
* Supports any authentication provider of your choice(REST API, OAuth, Basic Auth)
* Internationalization : Uses i18n
* Supports data validation

### SSR - Next.js Support 
React-Admin does not support SSR-Next.js. Therefore, it only helps you develop B2B and admin panel applications.

### Routing
React admin does it with react-router-dom to save routes. You need to create your own module and define it in the `<Route>` component.

```tsx title="src/customRoutes.js"
import * as React from "react";
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Foo from './Foo';
import Bar from './Bar';

export default [
    <Route exact path="/foo" component={Foo} />,
    <Route exact path="/bar" component={Bar} />,
];
```

Then, pass this array as customRoutes prop in the `<Admin>` component:

```tsx title="src/App.js"
import * as React from "react";
import { Admin } from 'react-admin';

import customRoutes from './customRoutes';

const App = () => (
    <Admin customRoutes={customRoutes} dataProvider={simpleRestProvider('http://path.to.my.api')}>
        ...
    </Admin>
);

export default App;
```

Now, when a user browses to /foo or /bar, the components you defined will appear in the main part of the screen.


### Data Provider Logic
When React-admin needs to communicate with API, it uses Data Provider.

<img src={admin_flow} alt="admin" />

Here are the React-Admin data provider methods:

```ts
const dataProvider = {
    getList:    (resource, params) => Promise,
    getOne:     (resource, params) => Promise,
    getMany:    (resource, params) => Promise,
    getManyReference: (resource, params) => Promise,
    create:     (resource, params) => Promise,
    update:     (resource, params) => Promise,
    updateMany: (resource, params) => Promise,
    delete:     (resource, params) => Promise,
    deleteMany: (resource, params) => Promise,
}
```
#### GraphQL Data Provider
We can say that React-Admin is a bit lacking in terms of both graphql provider and its documentation. 

React-Admin calls the GraphQL endpoint by running an introspection query for GraphQL.

```jsx title="App.js"
import React from 'react';
import { Component } from 'react';
import buildGraphQLProvider from 'ra-data-graphql-simple';
import { Admin, Resource } from 'react-admin';

import { PostCreate, PostEdit, PostList } from './posts';

const App = () => {

    const [dataProvider, setDataProvider] = React.useState(null);
    React.useEffect(() => {
        buildGraphQLProvider({ clientOptions: { uri: 'http://localhost:4000' } })
            .then(graphQlDataProvider => setDataProvider(() => graphQlDataProvider));
    }, []);

    if (!dataProvider) {
        return <div>Loading</div>;
    }

    return (
        <Admin dataProvider= {dataProvider} >
            <Resource name="Post" list ={PostList} edit ={PostEdit} create ={PostCreate} />
        </Admin>
    );
}

export default App;
```

When we want to see this data in a table, all GraphQL entities are queried requested by default(even if you don't add columns to the table). This is against GraphQL's approach and is a scenario we would not want.

The way to prevent this is to override all your queries.

```jsx title="src/dataProvider.js"
import buildGraphQLProvider, { buildQuery } from 'ra-data-graphql-simple';

const myBuildQuery = introspection => (fetchType, resource, params) => {
    const builtQuery = buildQuery(introspection)(fetchType, resource, params);

    if (resource === 'Command' && fetchType === 'GET_ONE') {
        return {
            // Use the default query variables and parseResponse
            ...builtQuery,
            // Override the query
            query: gql`
                query Command($id: ID!) {
                    data: Command(id: $id) {
                        id
                        reference
                        customer {
                            id
                            firstName
                            lastName
                        }
                    }
                }`,
        };
    }

    return builtQuery;
};

export default buildGraphQLProvider({ buildQuery: myBuildQuery })
```

Although this is a solution, it complicates your project in many ways (debugging, maintenence, etc...).

### React-Admin Avaible Providers
The providers that React admin supports are as follows:
* Simple Rest: [https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-simple-rest](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-simple-rest)
* Json Server: [https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-json-server](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-json-server)
* Simple GrapgQL: [https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-graphql-simple](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-graphql-simple)
* Local JSON: [https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-localstorage](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-localstorage)
* Local Strage: [https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-localstorage](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-localstorage)
* Supabase: [https://github.com/marmelab/ra-supabase](https://github.com/marmelab/ra-supabase)

[You can view the full list of providers here ->](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/DataProviders.html)

### Customization
With React-Admin, you can develop effective B2B applications and admin panels in a very short time. Although most of the processes are handled with hooks, the general architecture is built on components. In general, we can say that it is customizable but not very flexible. In some cases or business models, you may need to think about this yourself and make some additions.
#### UI/UX Customization: 
React-Admin offers solutions in component architecture. The disadvantage of this is that you will have difficulty meeting your customization needs or different business requests. These  customizable, but they can be a bit of a hard for different business models. 
#### Logic Customization:
React-Admin uses redux and redux-saga for state management. You should know these two technologies well. In some cases you may need to create the actions and reducers yourself. This is also a disadvantage for many situations.

### Pricing
In addition to these features it provides, React-Admin offers some modules as Enterprise-Edition.

A few of these modules are as follows:

* RBAC
* Editable-Datagrid
* Realtime
* Search 
* Navigation

[For more information about Enterprise-Edition and other modules](https://marmelab.com/ra-enterprise)

## Refine
refine is a React-based framework that helps you to develop admin panel, B2B and dashboard that can be fully customized with Ant Design.

refine directly provides Ant Design components and some hooks to work with those components. These hooks give you the required props for those Ant Design components.

refine is a collection of helper hooks, components and providers. They are all decoupled from your UI components and business logic, so they never keep you from customizing your UI or coding your own flow.

refine uses React Query for data processing, caching, and state management. In this respect, you do not need to define anything extra for every cases and model.

Although refine is a newer framework, it is successful in identifying deficiencies in development and producing solutions accordingly. Using new technologies, it offers users more effective and simpler development options.

### Installation
* Installation is very simple and customizable options can be added.

```bash
npx superplate-cli demo-refine-project
```

<img src={project_setup} alt="setup" />

### Features

* Configuration: One-line setup with superplate. Project setup is very simple. Using superplate you can choose the content of your project and the features you want to add. 

* UI: You have full control over the UI elements. Fully customizable, open to use. Works seamlessly with integrated Ant Design System.

* Out-of-the-box: Routing, networking, authentication, state managment, i18n and UI.

* Next.js / SSR integration: refine can be used with Next.js to SSR your pages.

* React Location: React Location router provider support 

### SSR - Next.js Support 
refine has support for SSR - Next.js. This is an important feature that separates refine from other frameworks. Thanks to this feature, refine provides the opportunity to develop B2C applications in addition to B2B and admin panel.

refine can be used with Next.js to SSR your pages. It doesn't get in the way and follows Next.js conventions and also provides helper modules when necessary.

#### SSR-Next.js Setup

```bash
npm i @pankod/refine @pankod/refine-nextjs-router
```

#### SSR-Next.js Basic Usage
`<Refine>` must wrap your pages in a custom App component. This way your pages are integrated to refine.

```tsx title=pages/_app.tsx
import { AppProps } from "next/app";

import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-nextjs-router";

const API_URL = "https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps): JSX.Element {
    return (
        <Refine
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            dataProvider={dataProvider(API_URL)}
        >
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </Refine>
    );
}

export default MyApp;
```
[For more information on how to add SSR-Next.js to your Refine project ->](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-and-concepts/ssr-nextjs/) 

### Routing
refine uses a customized Router Provider to save routes and navigate between pages. refine offers a much more flexible structure thanks to its routerProvider support.

A router provider must include the following methods:

```tsx
const routerProvider = {
    useHistory: () => {
        push: (...args) => any,
        replace: (...args) => any,
        goBack: (...args) => any,
    },
    useLocation: () => {
        pathname: string,
        search: string,
    },
    useParams: <Params extends { [K in keyof Params]?: string } = {}>() => Params,
    Prompt: React.FC<PromptProps*>,
    Link: React.FC<any>,
    RouterComponent?: React.FC<any>,
};
```

:::info
refine includes many  router providers to use in your projects like: 

* React Router
* React Location
* Next.js Router
:::

[To take a look at how other router providers are defined and working](https://refine.dev/docs/api-references/providers/router-provider/)

To activate router provider in refine, we have to pass the routerProvider to the `<Refine />` component.

<Tabs
defaultValue="react-router"
values={[
{label: 'React Router', value: 'react-router'},
{label: 'React Location', value: 'react-location'},
{label: 'Next.js Router', value: 'nextjs'}
]}>
<TabItem value="react-router">

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router";

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return <Refine routerProvider={routerProvider} />;
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react-location">

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-location";

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return <Refine routerProvider={routerProvider} />;
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nextjs">

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-nextjs-router";

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return <Refine routerProvider={routerProvider} />;
};
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You just need to tell the route of your component to the routerProvider.


### Data Provider Logic

A data provider is the place where a refine app communicates with an API.

<img src={refine_flow} alt="refine" />


A data provider must include following methods:

```ts
const dataProvider = {
    create: ({ resource, variables, metaData }) => Promise,
    createMany: ({ resource, variables, metaData }) => Promise,
    deleteOne: ({ resource, id, metaData }) => Promise,
    deleteMany: ({ resource, ids, metaData }) => Promise,
    getList: ({ resource, pagination, sort, filters, metaData }) => Promise,
    getMany: ({ resource, ids, metaData }) => Promise,
    getOne: ({ resource, id, metaData }) => Promise,
    update: ({ resource, id, variables, metaData }) => Promise,
    updateMany: ({ resource, ids, variables, metaData }) => Promise,
    custom: ({
        url,
        method,
        sort,
        filters,
        payload,
        query,
        headers,
        metaData,
    }) => Promise,
    getApiUrl: () => "",
};
```


:::note
Data hooks uses React Query to manage data fetching. React Query handles important concerns like caching, invalidation, loading states etc..
:::

#### GraphQL Data Provider
It is well covered by GraphQL data provider refine and explained step by step in the documentation.

refine GraphQL data provider is built with qql-query-builder and graphql-request. The purpose here is to send dynamic queries that we can do with qql-query-builder as requests with graphql-request. 

Query builder helps us build queries and mutations. We can use these queries with the getList, getMany and getOne methods in our data provider. On the other hand, the create, createMany, update, updateMany, deleteOne and deleteMany methods generate a mutation to send a request.

In order to create a query, we need to specify the fields that we will use from our data provider. Thanks to the MetaDataQuery, we pass these fields to our data provider and start using them.

#### Basic GraphQL Usage

```tsx src/App.tsx
import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-strapi-graphql";
import { GraphQLClient } from "graphql-request";

const client = new GraphQLClient("API_URL");

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <Refine
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            dataProvider={dataProvider(client)}
        />
    );
};
```

When sending the request, we must specify which fields will come, so we send fields in `metaData` to hooks that we will fetch data from.

{label: 'usage', value: 'usage'},
{label: 'output', value: 'output'},

* refine's motivation and main purpose are as follows: "Higher-level frontend frameworks can save you a lot time, but they typically offer you a trade-off between speed and flexibility." 
* While the admin panel allows you to make dashboard, B2B and B2C applications quickly, we offer you flexibility in your UI or business model.

#### UI/UX Customization: 
refine, comes ready-made decoupled from the UI, and is used. refine mostly touches UI components via hooks. The main advantage of this for you is that you can successfully perform any Business request or different case.
#### Logic Customization:
refine, works flawless with react-query. You don't have to worry about state management in your business model or when you encounter a different situation.

## AdminBro
AdminBro is an open-source package from  that adds an auto-generated admin panel to your Node.js application. You provide database models or schemas and AdminBro generates the user interface for you. 

You can connect your various databases to the admin interface and perform standard CRUD operations  on the records. In this way, it makes it to make changes on your data and provides you with a great deal of convenience.

You can quickly develop and customize the Admin panel with AdminBro.

It provides you with solutions and provides convenience when making admin panel and b2b applications. It is an open source project that has been in development and ongoing development for a long time. 

### Installation

We can say that it is difficult to install, but it is clearly explained step by step in the documentation.

:::note
Since AdminBro uses your existing framework to render its routes - you have to use one of our plugins.

There are plugins for:
* Express
* Hapi
* Koa.js
* Nest.js
:::note

Install the AdminBro along with the express plugin

```bash
npm install admin-bro @admin-bro/express
```

Then, we need to install some dependencies express and the express-formidable packages. express-formidable is a peer dependency for AdminBro

 ```bash
 npm install express express-formidable
 ```

[For detailed installation â†’](https://adminbro.com/tutorial-installation-instructions.html)

### Features 

* You can use any data from any source and make changes to the data(create, read, update, delete)
* Custom actions
* Custom resource decorators
* Form validation 
* A full-featured control panel can be created.
* Internationalization(i18n)

### SSR - Next.js Supportâ€‹
AdminBro does not support SSR-Next.js. It only helps you develop B2B and admin panel applications.

### Routing
Adminbro's routing processes are slightly different than others. You can also define the routes of the components that you have created custom here.

```jsx
const AdminBro = require('admin-bro')
const AdminBroExpress = require('@admin-bro/express')

const express = require('express')
const app = express()

const adminBro = new AdminBro({
  databases: [],
  rootPath: '/admin',
})

const router = AdminBroExpress.buildRouter(adminBro)
```
The concept of routing is handled in a different way and in general all routing operations are defined through this file.


### Data Provider Logic
It does not have a data provider exactly like other frameworks. It has a different structure. It has created functions for you to control your data. But there are rules that we must follow and do.

AdminBro can be connected to many different types of resources. Right now, they support the following options:

* Mongoose
* Sequelize
* TypeORM

To add resources , you first have to intall an adapter for the resource you want to use.

#### Install the Database Adapter and add resources

Let's take a look at an example made with the mongoose adapter.

```bash
npm install mongoose @admin-bro/mongoose
```

```tsx title="index.js"
const AdminBro = require('admin-bro')
const AdminBroExpress = require('@admin-bro/express')
const AdminBroMongoose = require('@admin-bro/mongoose')
 
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
 
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
 
AdminBro.registerAdapter(AdminBroMongoose)
 
const run = async () => {
  const connection = await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/users', {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true})
 
  const User = mongoose.model('User', { name: String, email: String, surname: String })
 
  const adminBro = new AdminBro ({
    Databases: [connection],
    rootPath: '/admin',
    resources: [User]
  })
  const router = AdminBroExpress.buildRouter(adminBro)
  app.use(adminBro.options.rootPath, router)
     
  app.listen(3000, ()=> {
    console.log('Application is up and running under localhost:3000/admin')
  })
}
run()
```
Here we first installed and connected mongoose. We then created a model and passed it to the AdminBro resource. AdminBro has built an interface for us where we can list our users. You can also add your own [custom adapters](https://adminbro.com/tutorial-writing-custom-adapters.html) and set up [custom resources](https://adminbro.com/tutorial-customizing-resources.html).

The logic is well covered and also well explained in the documentation. But we can say that it is complex compared to other frameworks. It can be difficult to use on big data. 

### Customization
AdminBro is good at customizing. You can connect your own adapters and customize your resources. These customizations are challenging and complex.

Some customizable features are as follows:
 * [Customize Resources](https://adminbro.com/tutorial-customizing-resources.html)
 * [Customize Actions](https://adminbro.com/tutorial-actions.html)
 * [Custom Validations](https://adminbro.com/tutorial-actions-validations.html)
 * [Customize dashboard](https://adminbro.com/tutorial-custom-dashboard.html)

#### UI/UX Customization:â€‹
It automatically offers you an interface option that you can use. You can also develop and customize your own components. You can do your own styling and write your own custom components, but for this customization, you need to follow and apply a few steps. It doesn't speed you up in UI development.

[For more information about developing your own components ->](https://adminbro.com/tutorial-writing-react-components.html)

### Pricing
All features of Adminbro are open source and accessible.

* Role-Based Access Control
* Content Management System
