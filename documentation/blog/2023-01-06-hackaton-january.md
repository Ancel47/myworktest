# The refine Open Source Hackathon




We're proud to have reached thousands of developers using **refine** in our first year, and we couldn't have done it without open source community! To celebrate this achievement with the community, we are excited to announce the launch of the first **refine** hackathon event.

This hackathon is an excellent opportunity for developers to showcase their skills and learn **refine**! 

You can win **$1500** and a special gifts along with **limited edition** swag kits!

We can't wait to see what amazing projects the participants will build projects using **refine**. 




## Together with Open Source Community

refine draws its strength from the open-source community, and we are grateful to have the support of [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and Appwrite[https://appwrite.io/] which has significant contributions to the open source community for our first hackathon!

It's worth noting that refine has built-in data provider support for both Strapi and Appwrite, so we believe they will be excellent backend solutions for your hackathon project.

Strapi and Appwrite will also be providing swag kits for the winners.
