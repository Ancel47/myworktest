## What is Multitenancy?

Multitenancy refers to a kind of architecture where a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple customers. In a multi-tenant environment, separate customers tap into the same hardware and data storage, creating a dedicated instance for each customer. Each tenantâ€™s data is isolated and remains invisible to others, but is running on the same server.
