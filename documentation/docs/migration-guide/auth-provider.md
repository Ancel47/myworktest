## Motivation behind the changes

Our motivation for modifying the `authProvider` prop in **refine** v4 is to enhance its flexibility and customization options to handle a wider range of use cases without over complicating the process.

We wanted to create a common interface for the `authProvider` methods to improve its transparency for developers for better understanding and debugging.

Previously, developers were expected to resolve the `authProvider` methods on success and reject them on failure. However, this approach had limitations, as rejected promises are generally associated with errors or unusual scenarios. Since some errors, such as incorrect login credentials, aren't necessarily failures and must be communicated to the user, rejected promises often led to confusion for developers and hindered the debugging process.

Now, the `authProvider` methods always return a resolved promise that includes an object with a success key. This key indicates whether the operation was successful or not, and in case of failure, an optional error key containing an `Error` object can be used to notify users.

Furthermore, the auth hooks no longer have default redirection paths, which had previously been a source of confusion for some developers. Instead, by adding a `redirectTo` property to the `authProvider` methods' return object, developers can have more control over the redirection after a successful operation.

## Naming changes

-   `AuthPovider` interface changed to `AuthBindings`.

    ```diff
    - import { AuthProvider } from "@refinedev/core";
    + import { AuthBindings } from "@refinedev/core";

    - const authProvider: AuthProvider = {/* ... */}
    + const authProvider: AuthBindings = {/* ... */}
    ```

-   `getUserIdentity` method of the `authProvider` changed to `getIdentity`.
-   `checkError` method of the `authProvider` changed to `onError`.
-   `checkAuth` method of the `authProvider` changed to `check`.

    ```diff
    const authProvider = {
    -     getUserIdentity,
    +     getIdentity,
    -     useCheckError,
    +     useOnError,
    -     checkAuth,
    +     check,
    }
    ```

-   `useAuthenticated` hook changed to `useIsAuthenticated`.

    ```diff
    - import { useAuthenticated } from "@refinedev/core";
    + import { useIsAuthenticated } from "@refinedev/core";
    ```

:::note

**refine** still supports the `authProvider@v3` for backward compatibility. We changed name to `legacyAuthProvider` and it will be removed in the next major version. If you want to continue using the `authProvider@v3` you can use it as `legacyAuthProvider` in your project.

```diff
- import { AuthProvider } from "@refinedev/core";
+ import { LegacyAuthProvider } from "@refinedev/core";

- const authProvider: AuthProvider = {/* ... */}
+ const authProvider: LegacyAuthProvider = {/* ... */}

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Refine
-           authProvider={authProvider}
+           legacyAuthProvider={authProvider}
        >
            <AppLayout />
        </Refine>
    );
};

```

Also you need to add `v3LegacyAuthProviderCompatible: true` to your auth hooks to continue using the `authProvider@v3` in your project.

```ts
import { useLogin } from "@refinedev/core";

const login = useLogin({
    // highlight-next-line
    v3LegacyAuthProviderCompatible: true,
});
```
