Refine being a meta-framework, it does not have a specific deployment configuration on its own.

Refine applications are usually built on top of the following frameworks, and you can follow their deployment guides to deploy your application.

- [Vite deployment guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)
- [Next.js deployment guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)
- [Remix deployment guide](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/deployment)

For convenience, we've created a [refinedev/Dockerfiles](https://github.com/refinedev/dockerfiles) GitHub repository that contains Dockerfiles for each of the frameworks above.
