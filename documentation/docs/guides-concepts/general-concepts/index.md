title: General Concepts
---

Refine is an extensible framework designed for rapidly building web applications. It offers a modern, **hook-based architecture**, a **pluggable system of providers**, and a robust **state management** solution. This section provides an overview of the key concepts in Refine.

## Resource Concept

In Refine, a **resource** is a central concept representing an **entity**, which ties together various aspects of your application.

They typically refers to a data entity, like `products`, `blogPosts`, or `orders`.

Resource definitions allows you to manage your application in a structured way, abstracting complex operations into simpler actions through various **providers** and **UI integrations**.

A typical resource definition looks like this:

```tsx title=App.tsx
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Refine
      resources={[
        {
          name: "products",
          list: "/my-products",
          show: "/my-products/:id",
          edit: "/my-products/:id/edit",
          create: "/my-products/new",
        },
      ]}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Refine>
  );
};
```

## Provider Concept

Providers are the building blocks of Refine, used to manage different aspects of your application, such as data fetching, routing, access control, and more.

They are pluggable, which means you can use the **built-in providers** or **create your own**. This allows you to customize the behavior of your application to suit your needs.

- **Data Provider**: Communication with the backend data source, handling data operations such as fetching, creating, updating, deleting records, caching, and invalidation.
- **Authentication Provider**: Manages user authentication and authorization processes. Handles redirection, error cases.
- **Access Control Provider**: Handles authorization and access control. Used to hide/disable buttons and menu items, or to protect routes and components.
- **Notification Provider**: Enables notification features like showing notification after successful mutations or errors.
- **I18n Provider**: Enables i18n features such as renderin translated menu items, button texts, table columns, page titles, and more.
- **Live Provider**: Enables real-time updates to your application. For example, when a user creates a new record, other users can see the new record in the list page without refreshing the page.
- **Router Provider**: Matches routes to resources, enables navigation features like breadcrumbs, automatic redirections after CRUD operations, rendering menu items.

## Hook Concept

refine adopts a hook-based architecture, a modern and powerful pattern in React development, which significantly enhances the development experience and application performance.

**refine**'s hooks are **headless**, which means they are library agnostic, provides **a unified interface** for your needs regardless of your library or framework of your choice.

For example, we have different built-in router providers for **React Router v6**, **Next.js**, **Remix**, **Expo** that handles routing in your application.

But we have a single `useGo` hook, exported from `@refinedev/core` package, can be used to navigate to a specific resource's page in your application **regardless of your routing solution**.

This is just one example, we have many other hooks for data fetching, authentication, access control, notifications, i18n and more.

They are all **headless**, **library agnostic**, and **unified**.

You might be using [Casbin](https://casbin.org) or [Cerbos](https://cerbos.dev) for authorization, we have a single `useCan` hook to control access in your components.

Or you may prefer either `next-i18next` or `react-i18next` for i18n, we have a single `useTranslate` hook to handle translation.

## Providers

### Data Provider

The Data Provider is the bridge between your frontend and your backend data source. It is responsible for handling all data-related operations such as fetching, caching, creating, updating, and deleting records.

Each data operation in the Data Provider is typically associated with a specific resource. For example, when fetching data for a `products` resource, the Data Provider will know which endpoint to hit and how to handle the response.

```tsx title=data-provider.ts
import { DataProvider } from "@refinedev/core";

const myDataProvider: DataProvider = {
  getOne: ({ resource, id }) => {
    fetch(`https://example.com/api/v1/${resource}/${id}`);
  },
  // other methods...
};
```

> Refine offers various built-in data providers for popular data sources like REST, Strapi, AirTable, Supabase, GraphQL, and more. See the [Data Providers](/docs/core/providers/data-provider) page for more information.

> See the [Data Fetching](/docs/guides-concepts/data-fetching/) guide for more information.

#### Hooks

You can use `useList`, `useOne`, `useCreate`, `useEdit`, `useShow` hooks to fetch data in your components.

```tsx title=show.tsx
import { useOne } from "@refinedev/core";

export const ShowPage = () => {
  const { data, isLoading } = useOne({ resource: "products", id: 1 });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  return <>{data.name}</>;
};
```

> See the [Data Fetching](/docs/guides-concepts/data-fetching) guide for more information.

### Authentication Provider

The Authentication Provider centralizes the authentication and authorization processes in **refine** applications.

It handles authentication and authorization processes such as login, logout, redirection, error handling, and more.

```tsx title=auth-provider.ts
import { AuthBindings } from "@refinedev/core'";

export const authProvider: AuthBindings = {
  login: async ({ email, password }) => {
    const { status } = handleLogin(email, password);

    if (status === 200) {
      return { success: true, redirectTo: "/dashboard" };
    } else {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: { name: "Login Error", message: "Invalid credentials" },
      };
    }
  },
  check: async (params) => ({}),
  logout: async (params) => ({}),
  onError: async (params) => ({}),
  register: async (params) => ({}),
  forgotPassword: async (params) => ({}),
  updatePassword: async (params) => ({}),
  getPermissions: async (params) => ({}),
  getIdentity: async (params) => ({}),
};
```

> See the [Authentication](/docs/guides-concepts/authentication/) guide for more information.

#### Components

You can use `Authenticated` component from `@refinedev/core` to protect your routes, components with authentication.

```tsx title=my-page.tsx
import { Authenticated } from "@refinedev/core";

const MyPage = () => (
  <Authenticated>
    <YourComponent />
  </Authenticated>
);
```

> See the [Authentication Components](/docs/guides-concepts/authentication#components) page for more information.

#### Hooks

You can use `useGetIdentity` hook to get current user.

```tsx title=show.tsx
import { useGetIdentity } from "@refinedev/core";

export const DashboardPage = () => {
  const {
    data: { name },
  } = useGetIdentity();

  return <>Welcome {name}!</>;
};
```

> See the [Authentication Hooks](/docs/guides-concepts/authentication#hooks) page for more information.

#### UI Integrations

We have pre-built components which works with Auth Provider out-of-the-box.

When provided, their Layout components can automatically render current user information on the header and add logout button to appropriate places.

You can also use `AuthPage` component of these integrations for `Login`, `Register`, `Forgot Password`, `Reset Password` pages.

See the [Auth Pages](#auth-pages) section below for live examples.

### Access Control Provider

The Access Control Provider manages what users can access or perform within the application based on their permissions.

It uses the resource definition to determine access rights. For instance, it can decide whether a user can edit or delete record for `products` resource based on the resource definition.

```tsx title=App.tsx
import { AccessControlProvider, Refine } from "@refinedev/core";

const myAccessControlProvider: AccessControlProvider = {
  can: async ({ resource, action }) => {
    if (resource === "products" && action === "delete") {
      return { can: false };
    }

    return { can: true };
  },
};

export const App = () => {
  return <Refine accessControlProvider={myAccessControlProvider}>{/* ... */}</Refine>;
};
```

> See the [Authorization](/docs/guides-concepts/authorization/) guide for more information.

#### Components

You can wrap `CanAccess` component to wrap relevant parts of your application to control access.

```tsx title=show-page.tsx
import { CanAccess } from "@refinedev/core";

export const ShowPage = () => {
  return (
    <CanAccess resource="users" action="show">
      <>
        User Page
        <CanAccess resource="users" action="block">
          // Only authorized users can see this.
          <BlockUserButton />
        </CanAccess>
      </>
    </CanAccess>
  );
};
```

#### Hooks

You can use `useCan` hook to control access in your components.

```tsx title=show.tsx
import { ErrorComponent, useCan } from "@refinedev/core";

export const ShowPage = () => {
  const { data: show } = useCan({ resource: "users", action: "show" });
  const { data: block } = useCan({ resource: "users", action: "block" });

  if (!show?.can) {
    return <ErrorComponent />;
  }

  return (
    <>
      User Details Page
      {block?.can && <BlockUserButton />}
    </>
  );
};
```

#### UI Integrations

When provided, our UI Integrations works out-of-the-box with Access Control Provider.

For example if user isn't authorized to see `orders` resource, it will be hidden on the sidebar menu automatically.

Or if the current user isn't authorized to delete a product, the delete button will be disabled or hidden automatically.

```tsx title=example.tsx
import { DeleteButton } from "@refinedev/antd"; // or @refinedev/mui, @refinedev/chakra-ui, @refinedev/mantine

export const ShowPage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      Product Details Page
      <DeleteButton /> // Only admins can see this.
    </>
  );
};
```

This applies to all buttons like `CreateButton`, `EditButton`, `ShowButton`, `ListButton`.

### Notification Provider

**refine** can automatically show notifications for CRUD operations and errors.

For example, after creating, updating, or deleting a record for `products` resource, or when an error occurs on form submission.

**refine** has out-of-the-box notification providers for popular UI libraries like **Ant Design**, **Material UI**, **Chakra UI**, and **Mantine**.

> See the [Notifications](/docs/api-reference/core/providers/notification-provider) guide for more information.

#### Hooks

Our **data hooks**, **mutation hooks**, and **auth hooks** can automatically show notifications for actions and errors.

It's also possible to modify these notifications per hook.

```tsx title=show.tsx
import { useDelete } from "@refinedev/core";

export const ShowPage = () => {
  const { mutate } = useDelete({ resource: "products" });

  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => {
        mutate({
          successNotification: () => ({
            message: "Product Deleted",
            description: "Product has been deleted successfully.",
            type: "success",
          }),
          errorNotification: () => ({
            message: "Product Delete Error",
            description: "An error occurred while deleting the product.",
            type: "error",
          }),
        });
      }}
    >
      Delete Product
    </Button>
  );
};
```

If you have a use-case that isn't covered, you can use `useNotification` hook to show notifications in your application.

```tsx title=show.tsx
import { useNotification } from "@refinedev/core";

export const ShowPage = () => {
  const { open, close } = useNotification();

  return (
    <>
      <Button
        onClick={() => {
          open?.({
            key: "my-notification",
            message: "Test Notification",
            description: "This is a test notification.",
            type: "success", // success | error | progress
          });
        }}
      >
        Show notification
      </Button>
      <Button
        onClick={() => {
          close?.("my-notification");
        }}
      >
        Close Notification
      </Button>
    </>
  );
};
```

### I18n Provider

I18n provider centralizes localization process in **refine** applications.

```tsx title=App.tsx
import { Refine, I18nProvider } from "@refinedev/core";

const i18nProvider: I18nProvider = {
    translate: (key: string, options?: any, defaultMessage?: string) => string,
    changeLocale: (lang: string, options?: any) => Promise,
    getLocale: () => string,
};

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Refine i18nProvider={i18nProvider} {/* ...*/}>
      {/* ... */}
    </Refine>
  )
}
```

#### Hooks

You can use `useTranslate`, `useSetLocale`, `useGetLocale` hooks to handle i18n in your components.

```tsx title=show.tsx
import { useTranslate, useSetLocale, useGetLocale } from "@refinedev/core";

export const ShowPage = () => {
  const translate = useTranslate();
  const setLocale = useSetLocale();
  const getLocale = useGetLocale();

  return (
    <>
      Current Locale: {getLocale()}
      <Button onClick={() => setLocale("en")}>Set Locale to English</Button>
      <Button onClick={() => setLocale("de")}>Set Locale to German</Button>

      <Button>{translate('Hello')</Button>
    </>
  );
};

```

#### UI Integrations

When provided, our UI Integrations works out-of-the-box with I18n Provider.

For example, it will automatically translate menu items, button texts, table columns, page titles, and more.

> See the [Internationalization](/docs/api-reference/core/providers/i18n-provider/) guide for more information.

### Router Provider

Router provider helps **refine** understand the relationship between resources and routes. Enables navigation features like breadcrumbs, automatic redirections after CRUD operations, rendering menu items, inferring hook parameters, and more.

We have built-in router integrations for the following packages:

- React Router v6
- Next.js
- Remix
- Expo Router (React Native)

> See the [Routing](/docs/guides-concepts/routing/) guide for more information.

#### Components

**UI Integration** components can infer resource information from the current URL.

For example, we are in the list page of `products` resource, we have `List` layout component and we are adding `CreateButton` from one of our UI Integrations to redirect user to the create page of the resource.

With **router provider** current resource information will be inferred from the current URL.

```tsx title=products.tsx
import { List, CreateButton } from "@refinedev/antd"; // or @refinedev/mui, @refinedev/chakra-ui, @refinedev/mantine

export const ProductsListPage = () => {
  return (
    // Instead of <List resource="products">
    <List>
      {/* Instead of <CreateButton resource="products" /> */}
      <CreateButton /> // Redirects to /products/new
    </List>
  );
};
```

> See the [Routing](/docs/guides-concepts/routing/) guide for more information.

#### Hooks

**refine** hooks can synchronize **resource**, **id**, **action** parameters from the current URL eliminates the need to pass them manually.

For example, `useShow` hook can infer `resource` and `id` parameters from the current URL.

```tsx title=show.tsx
import { useShow } from "@refinedev/core";

export const ShowPage = () => {
  // const { queryResult } = useShow({ resource: "products", id: 1 });
  // We don't need to pass "resource" and "id" parameters manually.
  const { queryResult } = useShow();

  const { data, isLoading } = queryResult;

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Loading />;
  }

  return <>{data?.data.name}</>;
};
```

Another example is `useTable` hook. While it can infer **resource**, **pagination**, **filters**, and **sorters** parameters from the current route, it can also update the current route if any of these parameters changes.

> See the [Routing](/docs/guides-concepts/routing/) guide for more information.

## UI Integrations

While **refine** itself is headless, it offers UI Integrations for popular UI libraries for:

- [Ant Design](/docs/api-reference/antd)
- [Material UI](/docs/api-reference/mui)
- [Chakra UI](/docs/api-reference/chakra-ui)
- [Mantine](/docs/api-reference/mantine)

These integrations use `@refinedev/core` under the hood, becomes a bridge between the UI library and the **refine** framework.

<Tabs wrapContent={false}>

<TabItem value="Ant Design">

import { AntdLayout } from './layout/antd';

<AntdLayout />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Material UI">

import { MaterialUILayout } from './layout/mui';

<MaterialUILayout />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Chakra UI">

import { ChakraUILayout } from './layout/chakra';

<ChakraUILayout />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Mantine">

import { MantineLayout } from './layout/mantine';

<MantineLayout />

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Layout

UI Integrations provides a Layout components, which renders the **sidebar menu**, **header**, and **content** area of your application.

It automatically renders the sidebar menu based on the **resource definitions**, and the header based on the **current user**.

### CRUD Pages

`List`, `Create`, `Edit`, `Show` components.

These components provides layout view based on the resource information automatically like:

- Header with title
- Breadcrumb
- Translated texts
- CRUD Buttons

On top of that, **refine** adds some features to these layouts:

- **Access Control**: If the current user isn't authorized to create a product, the create button will be disabled or hidden automatically.
- **Translation**: buttons, titles, columns will be translated to the current language of the user.

### Buttons

For example, our **UI Integrations** exports `CreateButton`, for redirecting the user to the create page of the resource.

While the button itself is imported from underlying UI package, **refine** adds some capabilities to it:

- **Routing**: when the button is clicked, the user will be redirected to the create page of the resource.
- **Access Control**: if current user isn't authorized, this button will be disabled or hidden automatically.
- **Translation**: the button's text will be translated to the current language of the user.

### Auth Pages

Common authentication pages like `Login`, `Register`, `Forgot Password`, `Reset Password` integrated with `AuthProvider` automatically.

<Tabs wrapContent={false}>

<TabItem value="Headless">

import { HeadlessAuth } from './auth-pages/headless';

<HeadlessAuth/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Ant Design">

import { AntdAuth } from "./auth-pages/antd";

<AntdAuth />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Material UI">

import { MaterialUIAuth } from "./auth-pages/mui";

<MaterialUIAuth />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Chakra UI">

import { ChakraUIAuth } from "./auth-pages/chakra";

<ChakraUIAuth />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Mantine">

import { MantineAuth } from "./auth-pages/mantine";

<MantineAuth />

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### UI Integration Hooks

UI Integration hooks uses `@refinedev/core` hooks under the hood, making it easier to use them in your UI specific components.

One example is, `useTable` hook from `@refinedev/antd` package. This hook uses `@refinedev/core`'s `useTable` under the hood, but returns props compatible with `Ant Design`'s `Table` component. So you don't need to manually map the props.

## Meta Concept

`meta` is a special property that can be used to provide additional information to **providers** and **UI Integrations**.

There are 3 ways to populate meta, they all will be **merged into a single meta property** and will be available to **providers** and **UI integrations**.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Meta from resource">

```tsx title=App.tsx
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Refine
      resources={[
        {
          name: "products",
          list: "/my-products",
          // highlight-start
          meta: {
            fromResource: "Hello from resource.meta",
          },
          // highlight-end
        },
      ]}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Refine>
  );
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Meta from hook">

```tsx title=show.tsx
import { useOne } from "@refinedev/core";

export const ShowPage = () => {
  const { data, isLoading } = useOne({
    resource: "products",
    id: 1,
    // highlight-start
    meta: {
      fromHook: "Hello from hook.meta",
    },
    // highlight-end
  });
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Meta from URL">

Navigate to the following URL:

```
https://example.com/products?fromURL=Hello%20from%20URL
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Given the above examples, meta fields from **3 different sources** will be available in the providers:

```tsx title=providers.tsx
import { AccessControlProvider, DataProvider } from "@refinedev/core";

export const myDataProvider = {
  getOne: async ({ meta }) => {
    console.log(meta.fromResource); // "Hello from resource.meta"
    console.log(meta.fromHook); // "Hello from hook.meta"
    console.log(meta.fromURL); // "Hello from URL"
  },
};

export const myAccessControlProvider = {
  can: async ({ meta }) => {
    console.log(meta.fromResource); // "Hello from resource.meta"
    console.log(meta.fromHook); // "Hello from hook.meta"
    console.log(meta.fromURL); // "Hello from URL"
  },
};
```

### Example Use Cases

- **Global filters**: pass a filter to your **data provider**.
- **Multi-tenancy**: make current tenant available id to providers.
- **Advanced Access Control**: configuration per resource.
- **Customize UI**: manage sidebar label and icon per resource.

These are some but not all examples of how you can use the `meta` property.

> See the [Refine Component](/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/) page for more information.

## State Management

**refine** leverages **React Query** for data fetching and caching, which enhances the performance and user experience of applications. React Query provides efficient data synchronization between your server and UI, making it easier to handle background updates, cache management, and data invalidation.

Key Aspects of State Management in refine:

- **Data Fetching and Caching**: **refine** handles data fetching with **built-in hooks** that automatically manage the loading states, caching, and updating of data. This integration means fewer boilerplate codes and a more streamlined approach to handling server-state.

- **Invalidation and Refetching**: One of the challenges in state management is knowing when to invalidate and refetch data. refine, through React Query, provides simple yet powerful mechanisms to control data refetching. This ensures that the UI always reflects the most current data.

- **Query Keys Structure**: Each data fetching operation in refine is associated with a unique query key. These keys are used to uniquely identify and cache server responses, making it easy to optimize performance by reusing cached data when needed.

- **Mutation and Cache Updates**: When a mutation (create, update, delete) occurs, refine allows for the automatic or manual invalidation of related queries. This ensures that the data your users interact with is always fresh and consistent with the backend.

## Developer Experience

### CLI

refine CLI allows you to interact with your **refine** project and perform certain tasks such as creating a new resource, managing version updates, swizzling components, running your project (build, start, dev).

> See the [CLI](/docs/packages/documentation/cli/) page for more information.

### Devtools

**refine devtools** is designed to help you debug and develop your refine apps. It will be a collection of features including monitoring queries and mutations, testing out inferencer generated codes, adding and updating refine packages from the UI and more.

> See the [Devtools](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/devtools) package for more information.

### Inferencer

`@refinedev/inferencer` is a package that **scaffolds** code **on the fly** for your application based on your **API responses**.

:::caution

Inferencer **scaffolds** some basic boilerplate code to be used as a **starting point** to save some time.

It's not **guaranteed** to work in all cases, and it's not meant to be used on **production**.

:::

> See the [Inferencer](/docs/packages/documentation/inferencer/) page for more information.

For example, the following code:

```tsx title="list.tsx"
import { AntdInferencer } from "@refinedev/inferencer/antd";
// or @refinedev/inferencer/mui, @refinedev/inferencer/chakra, @refinedev/inferencer/mantine, @refinedev/inferencer/headless

export const ProductList = () => {
  // Scaffolds List page.
  return <AntdInferencer />;
};

export const ProductShow = () => {
  // Scaffolds Show page.
  return <AntdInferencer />;
};

export const ProductEdit = () => {
  // Scaffolds Edit page with form.
  return <AntdInferencer />;
};

export const ProductCreate = () => {
  // Scaffolds Create page with form.
  return <AntdInferencer />;
};
```

An example of **List Page** scaffolded by inferencer looks like this;

```tsx title="generated-list.tsx"
import { List, ShowButton, useTable } from "@refinedev/antd";
import { BaseRecord, IResourceComponentsProps } from "@refinedev/core";
import { Space, Table } from "antd";
import React from "react";

export const ProductList: React.FC<IResourceComponentsProps> = () => {
  const { tableProps } = useTable({
    syncWithLocation: true,
  });

  return (
    <List>
      <Table {...tableProps} rowKey="id">
        <Table.Column dataIndex="id" title="Id" />
        <Table.Column dataIndex="name" title="Name" />
        <Table.Column dataIndex="price" title="Price" />
        <Table.Column
          title="Actions"
          dataIndex="actions"
          render={(_, record: BaseRecord) => (
            <Space>
              <ShowButton hideText size="small" recordItemId={record.id} />
            </Space>
          )}
        />
      </Table>
    </List>
  );
};
```
