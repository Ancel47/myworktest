## Basic Usage

We'll show the basic usage of `useForm` by adding an creating form.

```tsx title="src/posts/create.tsx"
import { useState } from "react";
import { useForm } from "@pankod/refine-core";

export const PostCreate = () => {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState();
    const { onFinish } = useForm({
        action: "create",
    });

    const onSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        onFinish({ title });
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
            <input onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)} />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
};
```

:::tip
By default, `useForm` sets the `action` from the URL.
