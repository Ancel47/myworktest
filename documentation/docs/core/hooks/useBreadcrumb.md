:::info Congratulations ðŸ¥‡

-   `label`: the label of the resource.
-   `to`: the route of the resource.
-   `icon`: the icon of the resource.

```tsx
import { useBreadcrumb } from "@pankod/refine-core";

export const Breadcrumb: React.FC = () => {
    const { breadcrumbs } = useBreadcrumb();

    return (
        <ul>
            {breadcrumbs.map(({ label, to, icon }) => (
                <li key={label}>
                    {icon}
                    {to ? <a href={to}>{label}</a> : label}
                </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
};
```

The `breadcrumbs` are created with your resource definitions. For example, if you have a resource with the following definition:

```tsx
[
    {
        name: "posts",
        icon: <div>icon</div>,
        list: () => <div>List Page</div>,
        create: () => <div>Create Page</div>,
    },
];
```

-   On the `list` page of the `posts` resource, the breadcrumbs look like this:  
    `[ { label: "Posts", to: "/posts", icon: <div>icon</div> } ]`

-   On the `create` page of the `posts` resource, the breadcrumbs look like this:  
    `[ { label: "Posts", to: "/posts", icon: <div>icon</div>, }, { label: "Create" } ];`

:::info
If resource has no `icon` property, the `icon` property of the breadcrumbs is `undefined`. Likewise, if the resource's list page is not found, the `to` property of the breadcrumbs is `undefined`.
:::

:::tip
If resource definition has `label` property, `useBreadcrumbs` uses the `label` property. Otherwise, the `name` property of the resource is used. Likewise, if resource definition has `route` property, `useBreadcrumbs` uses the `route` property. Otherwise, the `name` property of the resource is used.

If you have a nested resource definition as below:

```tsx
[
    {
        name: "cms",
    },
    {
        name: "users",
        parentName: "cms",
        list: () => <div>List Page</div>,
        create: () => <div>Create Page</div>,
    },
];
```

-   On the `list` page of the `users` resource, the breadcrumbs look like this:  
    `[ { label: "Cms" }, { label: "Posts", to: "/posts" } ]`

-   On the `create` page of the `users` resource, the breadcrumbs look like this:  
    `[ { label: "Cms" }, { label: "Posts", to: "/posts" }, {label: "Create"} ]`
