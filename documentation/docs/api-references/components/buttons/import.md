`<ImportButton>` uses Ant Design's [`<Button>`][Button] and [`<Upload>`][Upload] components. It wraps a [`<Button>`][Button] component with an [`<Upload>`][Upload] component and accepts props for [`<Button>`][Button] and [`<Upload>`][Upload] components separately.

It is meant to be used with [`useImport`][useImport] hook.
