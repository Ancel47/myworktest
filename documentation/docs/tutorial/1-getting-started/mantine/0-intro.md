### Where are we going?

In this unit, we will be covering the following steps:

-   Setting up your development environment
-   Creating a new project
-   Generating CRUD pages for your data model
-   Store your project in a git repository
-   Deploy your project to the cloud

As you work on your project, you will periodically commit your changes to GitHub. Netlify will use the files in your GitHub repository to build and publish your website on the internet at a unique address where anyone can view it.

Netlify will continuously monitor your GitHub repository for any committed changes, and will automatically rebuild and republish your site to reflect those changes. This allows you to easily update and maintain your website over time.
