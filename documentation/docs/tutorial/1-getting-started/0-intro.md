In this unit, we initialize our app using the **refine.new** platform. Generally, for local development, we are able to initialize a **refine** app using the **refine CLI**. However, this tutorial is intended to provide busy developers a jetspeed introduction to **refine** concepts with an app built and hosted quickly on **refine.new**.


### What is refine.new ?

**refine.new** is an extended service offered by **refine** that allows developers to initialize, build and deploy **refine** applications in the cloud by making step-by-step selections directly in a browser. It helps developers to quickly internalize **refine** concepts and see them in action with a few minutes' set up.

<summary>Follow these instructions, then go directly to "Generate CRUD pages automatically with Inferencer" section!</summary>

**Set up StackBlitz**

<UIConditional is="mui">

1. Click [here](https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/refinedev/refine/tree/master/examples/template-mui?file=src%2FApp.tsx) to open the Material UI template.

**Make Changes**

<UIConditional is="mui">

In the files panel, click on `src/App.tsx` to open it. Afterwards, go to this part of the tutorial to learn how to make changes to this file: [Generate CRUD pages automatically with Inferencer](/docs/tutorial/getting-started/mui/generate-crud-pages/)

</UIConditional>

**Create a GitHub Repository**

1. Press the "Connect Repository" button at the top of your list of files, enter a new name for your repository, and click "Create repo & push".

2. When you have changes to be commit to GitHub, a “Commit” button will appear at the top left of your workspace. Clicking on this will allow you to enter a commit message, and update your repository.

**What's next?**

<UIConditional is="mui">

Now you can navigate to [Generate CRUD pages automatically with Inferencer](/docs/tutorial/getting-started/mui/generate-crud-pages) to start building with **refine**!
