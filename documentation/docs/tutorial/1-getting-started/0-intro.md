In this unit, we make our way through initializing a React admin panel app using the [**refine.new**](https://refine.new) platform and examine the app's features.

Generally, for local development, we are able to initialize a **refine** app using the [**refine CLI**](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/documentation/cli/). However, this tutorial is intended to provide busy developers a jetspeed introduction to **refine** concepts with an app built and hosted quickly on **refine.new**.


### What is refine.new ?

**refine.new** is an extended service offered by **refine** that allows developers to initialize, build and deploy **refine** applications in the cloud by making step-by-step selections directly in a browser. It helps developers to quickly internalize **refine** concepts and see them in action with a few minutes' set up.

<summary>Follow these instructions, then go directly to "Inferencer for CRUD Pages" section!</summary>

**Set up StackBlitz**

1. Click [here](https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/refinedev/refine/tree/master/examples/template-mui?file=src%2FApp.tsx) to open the Material UI template.

2. Click “Sign in” on the top right to log in using your GitHub credentials.

3. In the upper left of the StackBlitz editor window, click the "fork" button to fork the template (save to your own account dashboard).

4. After the project loads, you will see a live preview of the “refine-mui-boilerplate” starter.


**Make Changes**

In the files panel, click on `src/App.tsx` to open it. Afterwards, go to this part of the tutorial to learn how to make changes to this file: [Inferencer for CRUD Pages](/docs/tutorial/getting-started/inferencer-for-crud-pages/)


**Create a GitHub Repository**

1. Press the "Connect Repository" button at the top of your list of files, enter a new name for your repository, and click "Create repo & push".

2. When you have changes to be commit to GitHub, a “Commit” button will appear at the top left of your workspace. Clicking on this will allow you to enter a commit message, and update your repository.


**What's next?**

Now you can navigate to [Inferencer for CRUD Pages](/docs/tutorial/getting-started/inferencer-for-crud-pages) to start building with **refine**!
