**refine** is a React-based framework. So, some preliminary knowledge of [**React**](https://react.dev/learn) and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is absolutely required. This tutorial is an ideal try for a developer who has already worked with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) or [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/1.16.0/tutorials/blog) and experimented with their internals.

As mentioned previously, most of the code for the app is generated by [**refine.new**](https://refine.new), [**refine**](https://refine.dev/docs/tutorial/introduction/index/)'s extended service for hosting apps on the cloud. **refine.new** makes it possible to easily initialize, build and launch the app by following a set of directions from start to finish.


### Node.js

In order to develop and run the **refine** application locally, we need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and corresponding version of `npm` installed in our system. We recommend the latest stable versions, but [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version above `v 14` should be good to go. So, please go ahead and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) in your system.


### Github Account
In order to publish and deploy a version of the app from your local machine to a cloud hosting platform of your choice, you'll also need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (or a similar repository hub).
