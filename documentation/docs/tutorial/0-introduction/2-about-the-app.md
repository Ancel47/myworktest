Our app is a basic admin panel to manage blog posts. It will be created as default at initialization by the **refine.new**, which employs the **refine CLI** in the background. Generally, for your custom app, you need to remove the blog app resources and then start tweaking according to your requirements. However, for the simple purposes of this tutorial, we'll stick with the blog app.

As you'll see in the next unit, we will initialize the app using the **refine.new** platform.
