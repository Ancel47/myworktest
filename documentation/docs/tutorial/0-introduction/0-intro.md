## About this Tutorial

This tutorial guides us through the process using **refine.new** to quickly initialize, build and launch a fully-functional admin panel üöÄ.

It step by step covers what constitutes a basic **refine** app and explores fundamental **refine** concepts, namely the `dataProvider`, `authProvider` and `resources` props.

Most of the code is already generated by the magic of `refine.new`. So, the articles mainly present low level inspection of biolerplate code to show how **refine** works under the hood. Posts related to `dataProvider` and `resources` explain how **refine** handles API calls and RESTful routing for implementing CRUD actions. Towards the later part of the series, we deep dive into the implementation of CRUD pages using Material UI components. In the end, we see how authentication is implemented in a **refine** app.

We'll cover the following topics:

-   Initializing an admin dashboard app using **refine.ew**
-   Understanding [`dataProvider`](/docs/api-reference/core/providers/data-provider/)
-   The concept of the [`resources`](docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config.md#resources) prop
-   Adding CRUD pages to your project
-   The `authProvider` prop and Auth Pages

:::note
If you would rather start exploring **refine** with some examples before diving in, visit our [examples](/docs/examples/) page and choose an example to open and explore it in an online editor.
