## Overview

In [Unit 2](#), we created the CRUD pages automatically with Inferencer. In this unit, we will create the CRUD pages manually using the codes generated by Inferencer. So, you can customize the pages as you wish.

## Creating List Page

First, let's create our file under the `src/pages/posts` folder. We will name it `list.tsx`. Then, we will copy the list page code generated by Inferencer and paste it into the file.

To copy the code and paste it into the file, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the `localhost:3000/posts` in your browser.

2. Click on the "Show Code" button in the bottom right corner of the page.

3. You can see the list page code generated by Inferencer. Click on the "Copy" button to copy the code.

4. Paste the code into the you created, `list.tsx` file.

You can see the list page code generated by Inferencer below:

```tsx live previewOnly previewHeight=600px url=http://localhost:3000/posts
setInitialRoutes(["/posts"]);

import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import {
    Layout,
    ReadyPage,
    notificationProvider,
    ErrorComponent,
} from "@pankod/refine-antd";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";
import { AntdInferencer } from "@pankod/refine-inferencer/antd";

import "@pankod/refine-antd/dist/reset.css";

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <Refine
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
            Layout={Layout}
            ReadyPage={ReadyPage}
            notificationProvider={notificationProvider}
            catchAll={<ErrorComponent />}
            resources={[
                {
                    name: "posts",
                    list: AntdInferencer,
                    show: AntdInferencer,
                    create: AntdInferencer,
                    edit: AntdInferencer,
                },
            ]}
        />
    );
};

render(<App />);
```

Instead of coding the list page component from scratch, Inferencer've created the required code base on API response, so that we can customize.

## Understanding the List Component

-   `<List/>` is a **refine** component that is used to presentation purposes like showing create button or page title etc.

    Refer to the [`<List/>`](/docs/api-reference/antd/components/basic-views/list) documentation for more information.

-   `<Table/>` is a native **Ant Design** component. It renders records row by row as a table.

    > `<Table/>` expects a `rowKey` prop as the unique key of the records. In this example, Inferencer use `id` field as the `rowKey`.

    You can find more information about `<Table/>` component from [Ant Design Table](https://ant.design/components/table/).

-   `useTable` hook returns the values needed by the `<Table/>` component in the `tableProps` variable.

    This is the point where the ✨real magic✨ happens!

    `useTable` hook fetches data from API and wraps them with various helper hooks required for the `<Table/>` component. Data interaction functions like sorting, filtering, and pagination will be instantly available on the `<Table/>` with this single line of code.

    You can find more information about `useTable` hook from [useTable](/docs/api-reference/antd/hooks/table/useTable/).

-   `<Table.Column/>` is a native **Ant Design** component. It renders a column in the table.

    -   `dataIndex` prop is used to specify the field of the record that will be rendered in this column.
    -   `render` prop is used to render custom content in the column. In this example, we use `render` prop to render the `content` field using `<MarkdownField/>` component.

        You can find more information about `<MarkdownField/>` and other field components from [Field Components](/docs/api-reference/antd/components/fields/markdown/).

-   `<EditButton/>` and `<ShowButton/>` are **refine** components that are used to navigate to the edit and show pages of the record.

-   `<DeleteButton/>` is a **refine** component that is used to delete the record.

### Handling Relationships

Each post includes the `category` field. But, it only includes the `id` of the category. This is a foreign key that points to the `categories` resource. In the `categories` resource, we can see the `title` field. So, in order to display the category `title` in the table, we can use the `useMany` hook provided by **refine**. This hook allows us to fetch data for multiple records in a single request by providing the `id`'s of the related records. In this case, we need to provide the `id`'s of the posts' categories. It is particularly useful when we need to fetch related data for multiple records.

[Refer to the `useMany` documentation for more information &#8594](/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/data/useMany/)

In this example, each post record has a `category` field as below:

```ts title="https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev/posts"
{
  ...
  "category": {
    "id": 1
  }
  ...
},
{
  ...
  "category": {
    "id": 2
  }
  ...
}
```

We can use the `useMany` hook to fetch the full category records for each of these posts, like this:

```tsx
import { useMany } from "@pankod/refine-core";

const { data } = useMany({
    resource: "categories",
    ids: posts.map((post) => post.category.id),
});
```

This will pass the `resource` and `ids` to the `dataProvider`'s `getMany` function. The `dataProvider` will then make a single request to the API to fetch the full records for each category related to the posts. The resulting `data` variable will be an array of category records, like this:

```ts
[
    {
        id: 1,
        title: "mock category title",
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        title: "another mock category title",
    },
];
```

We can then use this `data` array to display the `title` of each category in the table.

## Adding the List Page to the App

Now that we have created the list page, we need to add it to the `App.tsx` file.

1. Open `src/App.tsx` file on your editor.

2. Import the created `PostList` component.

3. Replace the `AntdInferencer` component with the `PostList` component.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import {
    Layout,
    ReadyPage,
    notificationProvider,
    ErrorComponent,
} from "@pankod/refine-antd";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";
import { AntdInferencer } from "@pankod/refine-inferencer/antd";

//highlight-next-line
import { PostList } from "pages/posts/list";

import "@pankod/refine-antd/dist/reset.css";

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <Refine
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
            Layout={Layout}
            ReadyPage={ReadyPage}
            notificationProvider={notificationProvider}
            catchAll={<ErrorComponent />}
            resources={[
                {
                    name: "posts",
                    //highlight-next-line
                    list: PostList,
                    edit: AntdInferencer,
                    show: AntdInferencer,
                    create: AntdInferencer,
                },
            ]}
        />
    );
};
export default App;
```
