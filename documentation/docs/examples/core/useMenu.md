`useMenu` is used to get menu items derived from the resources. These items include a link to the dashboard page (if it exists) and links to the user-defined resources (passed as children to `<Refine />`). This example shows how to use the `useMenu` hook.

[Refer to the **refine** useMenu hook documentation for more information. â†’](/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/ui/useMenu/)
