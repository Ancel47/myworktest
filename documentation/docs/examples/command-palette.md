[kbar](https://kbar.vercel.app/) is a fully extensible `Command` + `K` interface for your site.

`Command` / `CTRL` + `K` interfaces are used to create a web experience where any type of action users would be able to do via clicking can be done through a command menu.

Try it out â€“ press `Cmd` + `K` (macOS) or `CTRL` + `K` (Linux/Windows).
