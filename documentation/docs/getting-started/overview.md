## What is refine?

**refine** is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based framework for building data-intensive applications in no time :sparkles: It ships with [Ant Design System](https://ant.design/), an enterprise-level UI toolkit.

Refine offers lots of out-of-the box functionality for rapid development, without compromising extreme customizability. Use-cases include, but are not limited to *admin panels*, *B2B applications* and *dashboards*.
###

## Key features

💾 **Zero-configuration**: One-line setup with [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate). It takes less than a minute to start a project.

📦 **Out-of-the-box** : Routing, networking, authentication, state management, i18n and UI.

🔌 **Backend Agnostic** : Connects to any custom backend. Built-in support for REST API, Strapi, NextJS and Airtable.

📝 **Native Typescript Core** : You can always opt out for plain Javascript.

🔘 **Decoupled UI** : UI components are exposed directly without encapsulation. You have full control on UI elements.

🐜 **Powerful Default UI** : Works seamlessly with integrated Ant Design System. (Support for multiple UI frameworks is on the Roadmap)

📝 **Boilerplate-free Code** : Keeps your codebase clean and readable.

### Motivation

Higher-level frontend frameworks can save you a lot time, but they typically offer you a trade-off between speed and flexibility. 

After many years of experience in developing B2B frontend applications and working with popular frameworks, we came up with a new apporach to tackle this dilemma. This is how **refine** is born.

**Refine** is a collection of helper [hooks](#), [components](#) and [providers](#). They are all decoupled from your UI components and business logic, so they never keep you from customizing your UI or coding your own logic.

As **refine** is totally *unopinionated* about UI and logic, it's strongly *opinionated* about three parts of your application:

1. **API Networking**
2. **State Management**
3. **Authentication & Authorization**

We believe, these are the most important components of a data-intensive frontend application and should be handled in a robust way by leveraging industry best practices.

**refine** guarantees you a perfect implementation of these building blocks in your project, so you can focus on your development.
