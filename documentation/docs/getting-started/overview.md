## What is refine?


**refine** is a highly versatile **React** framework that enables the rapid development of a wide range of web applications. From **internal tools**, **admin panels**, **B2B apps** and **dashboards**, it serves as a comprehensive solution for building any type of **CRUD** applications. 

It significantly **simplifies the development process** and **eliminates the repetitive tasks** by providing industry-standard solutions for crucial aspects of a project, including **authentication**, **access control**, **routing**, **networking**, **state management**, and **i18n**. 

**refine** is _headless by design_ and offers unlimited styling and customization possibilities, empowering developers to create tailored and fully functional applications that meet specific project requirements.


## What do you mean by "headless" ?


refine's headless architecture is all about giving you the freedom to create.

### Headless in UI

Instead of being a limited set of pre-styled components, **refine** is a collection of helper `hooks`, `components` and `providers`. They are all decoupled from your _UI_ _components_ and _business logic_, so they never keep you from customizing your _UI_ or coding your own flow.

 It means, **refine** just works _seamlessly_ with any _custom designs_ or _UI frameworks_. Thanks to it's headless architecture, you can use popular CSS frameworks like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or even create your own styles from scratch.

refine also ships with ready-made integrations for [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for convenience. 



### Headless in Routing

For the routing, refine's headless approach shines too. It doesn't tie you to a single routing method or library. Instead, it offers a simple routing interface with built-in integrations for popular libraries.

This means you can use refine seamlessly in different platforms like React Native, Electron, Next.js, Remix etc. without any extra steps for the setup.


## Use cases

**refine** shines when it comes to _data-intensive_ applications like _admin panels_, _dashboards_ and _internal tools_. Thanks to the built-in **SSR support**, **refine** can also power _customer-facing_ applications like _storefronts_.
