Now we've learned the data fetching and manipulation essentials of Refine. In this unit, we'll learn how to add authentication to our application and the essentials of authentication in Refine.

Refine provides an easy to manage authentication interface that can be used with any authentication provider with very little effort.

This unit will cover the following topics:

- Learning the [`AuthProvider`](#) interface by creating an authentication provider,
- Usage of the auth hooks and components such as `useLogin`, `useIsAuthenticated` hooks as well as `<Authenticated />` and `<AuthPage />` components,
- Integrating with the data providers.

This unit will be router and UI framework agnostic. Related parts of authentication for the router and UI framework will be covered in the next units.
