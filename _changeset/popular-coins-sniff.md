feat: add `ThemedLayoutV2` component and `useSiderVisible` hook

`ThemeLayout` is deprecated. Added `ThemedLayoutV2` instead. This update fixed some UI problems in the layout. Also, with the new `useSiderVisible` hook, it's easier to collapse/uncollapse the `Sider`.

See here for detailed [migration guideline](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/antd/components/antd-themed-layout/#migrate-themedlayout-to-themedlayoutv2).
