"@refinedev/codemod": patch
---

The latest major update in `@refinedev/mui` to support `@mui/x-data-grid@6` has been released. This update introduces some changes to the existing codebases that `refine-v3-to-v4` codemod cannot cover or has no relation to. We've updated the codemod to install the `v4` version of `@refinedev/mui` to avoid any issues.
