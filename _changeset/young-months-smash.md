Fine-tuning the invalidation process by setting up additional filters and options for the invalidation.

Now after a successful mutation, refine will invalidate all the queries in the scope but trigger a refetch only for the active queries. If there are any ongoing queries, they will be kept as they are.

After receiving a realtime subscription event, refine will invalidate and refetch only the active queries.
