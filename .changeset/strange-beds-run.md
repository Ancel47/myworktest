- Moved helpers to separate files and updated the exports to make it compatible with `swizzle` feature.
- Added `refine.config.js` to configure the `swizzle` feature.
- `stringify` helper is now exported from `@pankod/refine-simple-rest` package.
- `axios` instance is now exported from `@pankod/refine-simple-rest` package to allow users to configure the data provider without adding `axios` dependency.
