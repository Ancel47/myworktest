Add a simple and transparent telemetry module to collect usage statistics defined within a very limited scope.

Tracking is completely safe and anonymous. It does not contain any personally identifiable Information and does not use cookies. Participation is optional and users can opt out easily.

You can check it here for [details](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-and-concepts/telemetry/telemetry/).
