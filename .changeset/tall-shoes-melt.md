**Upgrade to Remix v2**

Upgraded `@refinedev/remix-router` to use `Remix v2`. This version change **does not** contain any breaking changes on the `@refinedev/remix-router` side.

Depending on your project's status, if you decide to upgrade to `Remix v2`, you may or may not need to make necessary changes to your project. Please refer to the [Remix v2 upgrade guide](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/v2) for more information.

If your project is created with `create-refine-app` which already initializes Remix projects using the v2 routing convention, you'll need to make the below changes to get rid of the warnings:

```diff
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
-  future: {
-    v2_routeConvention: true,
-  },
};
```

Due to the change in its default value, you may also need to set `serverModuleFormat` to `"cjs"` in your `remix.config.js` file:

```diff
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').RemixConfig */
module.exports = {
+  serverModuleFormat: "cjs",
};
```

Other than the changes mentioned above, `@refinedev/remix-router` and rest of the Refine packages should work as expected without requiring any changes.

**Migration Guide for `@refinedev/remix-router`**

Install the latest version of `@refinedev/remix-router` and `@refinedev/cli`:

```bash
npm i @refinedev/remix-router@latest @refinedev/cli@latest
```

You'll also need to update your remix dependencies:

```bash
npm i @remix-run/node@latest @remix-run/react@latest @remix-run/serve@latest
```

Please refer to the [Remix v2 upgrade guide](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/v2) for more information.

You may also receive a warning when you try to build and run your production build on your local. This is because `@remix-run/serve` requires a built path to be passed to it. `@refinedev/cli` will provide a fallback value for this which may work for your app but CLI will still warn you about it. You can either ignore the warning or provide a built path to `start` command.

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-    "start": "refine start",
+    "start": "refine start ./build/index.js",
  },
}
```

There should be no changes necessary regarding `@refinedev/remix-router` but your app may need to be updated according to the changes in `Remix v2`. Please refer to the [Remix v2 upgrade guide](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/v2) for more information.
