Updated query keys to be more consistent and structured.

Added mutation keys to the `useMutation` calls with the same structure as the query keys.

Added `options.useNewQueryKeys` option to the `<Refine>` component for opting into the new query keys.

Check out the [documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/#usenewquerykeys) for more information.
