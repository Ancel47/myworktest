Added ability to compare `or` filters. This was a missing feature on filters in `useTable` hook. With this feature, we will prevent `or` filter bugs (Resolves #2124) such as re-adding the same filters and being unable to modify `or` filter. To remove `or` filter with `merge` behavior, you should pass an empty object as `value`.
